        A shopping basket is an incomplete order that contains items. It can be
        converted to a completed order after the user logs in. Each item in an
        order is for a particular jewelry, a quantity of that jewelry to be
        purchased, and a price per item. The price of the jewelry is always the
        price of the first item of jewelry added to the shopping cart, which in
        turn is always the cheapest available inventory price.
      </li>
      <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40">
        The quantities of jeweleries in the shopping basket can be updated by
        the user, and items can be removed from the shopping basket.
      </li>
      <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="40" data-line-end="41">
        The jeweleries available for sale are stored in an inventory. Each
        inventory record has a date added and is for a particular item. The
        inventory contains a stock quantity available at a particular per-item
        price. There can be several inventory records for a jewelry,
        representing different shipments that arrived at the e-commerce site on
        different dates or that have a different price.
      </li>
      <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">
        The user will always be advertised prices from the cheapest inventory
        for each jewelry. When a user adds a jewelry to her shopping basket, she
        is guaranteed this price.
      </li>
      <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="42" data-line-end="43">
        A user can purchase only jeweleries that are in stock.
      </li>
      <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44">
        When a user converts his shopping basket to an order, the availability
        of sufficient inventory to complete the order is checked. If
        insufficient jewelry is available, the user is alerted, and the
        quantities in the shopping basket are updated; this situation can occur
        if a user adds more jewelry to his basket than is available.
      </li>
      <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="44" data-line-end="45">
        When sufficient inventory is available to complete an order, the
        quantity of jewelry in the inventory is reduced as the order is
        finalized. The inventory reduced is always the oldest inventory of that
        jewelry.
